# Major-project-codes

This project was made as a major project by me and my friend to be presented as part of our course.

The main things you need in this project would be -

  1. Arduino Uno
  2. Breadboard
  3. Jumping wires
  4. Servo Motor
  5. Ultrasonic sensor/Sonar sensor
  6. Arduino IDE
  7. Processing 3.3.4

We connected the Arduino Uno to the breadboard and from there to the Servo Motor and Ultrasonic Sensor.
The Sensor has to fitted above the Servo Motor for better visual representation.

We used a car to fit the sensor into and provide some prototype of what we actually thought of making and explaining it easily to the invigilator.

You can use anything vehicle to showcase this.

If you have any other idea regarding this, feel free to implement it as well.

If you succeed in making something incredible using this, do share it with me !!

If any queries, do ask by messaging me.
